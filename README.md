Sauce Javascript Project
===

Hopefully this demonstrates that I can:

*   write Javascript
*   write README files in Markdown on Github
*   do all the above while drinking beer. IPAs, even.

Requirements
===
You must have sinatra installed:

```
gem install sinatra
```

Then you can run the web server as follows:

```
ruby index.rb
```

Then navigate the browser to ```http://localhost:4567``` and you'll be in business.
